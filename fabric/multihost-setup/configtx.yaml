#   ORDERER

Orderer: &OrdererDefaults
    # Orderer Type: The orderer implementation to start.
    # Available types are "solo" and "kafka".
    #
    # ABW TODO: This needs to be kafka, and the orderer config needs to be 
    # adjusted accordingly.
    OrdererType: solo

    # Addresses here is a nonexhaustive list of orderers the peers and clients can
    # connect to. Adding/removing nodes from this list has no impact on their
    # participation in ordering.
    # NOTE: In the solo case, this should be a one-item list.
    Addresses:
        - orderer.abw.com:7050

    # Batch Timeout: The amount of time to wait before creating a batch.
    BatchTimeout: 2s

    # Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block.
    BatchSize:
        # Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a
        # batch.
        MaxMessageCount: 10

        # Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
        # the serialized messages in a batch. If the "kafka" OrdererType is
        # selected, set 'message.max.bytes' and 'replica.fetch.max.bytes' on
        # the Kafka brokers to a value that is larger than this one.
        AbsoluteMaxBytes: 98 MB

        # Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed
        # for the serialized messages in a batch. A message larger than the
        # preferred max bytes will result in a batch larger than preferred max
        # bytes.
        PreferredMaxBytes: 512 KB

    # Max Channels is the maximum number of channels to allow on the ordering
    # network. When set to 0, this implies no maximum number of channels.
    MaxChannels: 0

    Kafka:
        # Brokers: A list of Kafka brokers to which the orderer connects. Edit
        # this list to identify the brokers of the ordering service.

#   Different configuration profiles may be encoded here to be specified as

#   are to be used for generating the orderer genesis block. With the correct
#   consortium members defined in the orderer genesis block, channel creation
#   requests may be generated with only the org member names and a consortium
#   name.
